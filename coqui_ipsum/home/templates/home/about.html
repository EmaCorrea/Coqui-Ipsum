	<h4> What is Coqui Ipsum? </h4>

	<p>
		Simply put, it’s a take on the lorem ipsum filler text used when doing design mockups.  I was mocking up a web design one day and needed a few words to fill out a link.  “Lorem ipsum bacon” popped into my head, so I plugged that into my HTML.  Later that day, it hit me.  Make a lorem ipsum generator but use types and cuts of meat.
